# Axiom Lambda Extension

Use Axiom Lambda Extension to send logs and platform events of your Lambda function to [Axiom](https://axiom.co/). Axiom detects the extension and provides you with quick filters and a dashboard.

With the Axiom Lambda extension, you can forget about the extra configuration of CloudWatch and subscription filters.
